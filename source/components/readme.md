# Goal

Supporticon provides some small React components that handle fetching and displaying data from Supporter, similar to React Widgets.

These components should be easy to drop into your projects, pass in the relevant props, and they should be good to go.

Components can be seen [here](https://everydayhero.github.io/supporticon/components)
