# Supporticon

Supporticon provides some small React components that handle fetching and displaying data from Supporter, similar to [React Widgets](https://github.com/everydayhero/react-widgets). These components depend on [Constructicon](https://github.com/everydayhero/constructicon) for UI.

These components should be easy to drop into your projects, pass in the relevant props, and they should be good to go.
