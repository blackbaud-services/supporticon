# Supporticon [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/supporticon.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supporticon)

Supporticon provides some React components that handle fetching and displaying data from JustGiving. These components depend on [Constructicon](https://github.com/blackbaud-services/constructicon) for UI.

These components should be easy to drop into your projects, pass in the relevant props, and they should be good to go.
